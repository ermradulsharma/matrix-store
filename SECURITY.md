## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Matrix Store seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do not open a public issue.** This gives potential attackers a chance to exploit the vulnerability before we can fix it.
2.  **Email the maintainer/s** directly at [mradulsharma.dev@gmail.com](mailto:mradulsharma.dev@gmail.com) (or the appropriate contact email if different).
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.
4.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will give proper credit for your contribution.
